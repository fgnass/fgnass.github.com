title: Serving PHP files with Yeoman
---

I recently did some PHP development and thought it would be nice if I could use
[Yeoman's](http://yeoman.io) built-in development server to serve dynamic files,
too.

The first step was to install `php-cgi` which isn't included with OS X.

    brew tap homebrew/dupes
    brew tap josegonzalez/homebrew-php
    brew install php54

The next step was to add a middleware to Yeoman's server in order to invoke
the PHP interpreter for all files ending with `.php`.

I found the [node-cgi](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-cgi) module that
Nathan ([@TooTallNate](https://twitter.com/tootallnate)) had written to serve
the GitWeb interface through Node, but unfortunately node-cgi only handles
scripts with a shebang that are located in a `cgi-bin` directory.

I needed a module that would serve scripts from arbitrary locations and
choose the interpreter based on the file's extension. As it should also support
welcome-files so I decided to [roll my own](https://github.com/fgnass/gateway).

While Yeoman was now able to serve PHP files, one important aspect was still
missing: The server had to inject the liverelaad snippet into the response that
was generated by the PHP interpreter.

Hence I wrote a second middleware called
[tamper](https://github.com/fgnass/gateway). What tamper does is that it
temporarily overwrites the `write()`, `writeHead()` and `end()` methods of the
ServerResponse object. Before the headers are sent to the client, tamper invokes
a callback function that decides whether the response body should be captured or
whether it should be streamed to the client without further tampering.

With these two little patches `yeoman server` now happily serves PHP files.

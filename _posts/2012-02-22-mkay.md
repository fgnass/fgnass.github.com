title: Better than templates
layout: post

When I saw a project called Jade for jQuery being featured on DailyJS yesterday I thought I should take the time and promote my lightweight Jade/HAML-style DOM builder I wrote some month ago.

In his [jQuery Roundup](http://dailyjs.com/2012/02/21/jquery-roundup/) Alex Young writes about jQuery and Jade:
> Seeing as both of these technologies are all about CSS selectors, I’ve always felt like it makes sense to use them together.

I agree that using CSS selectors not only to _query_ but also to _create_ elements makes a lot of sense. But using a rather huge templating library like Jade on the client feels just wrong.

What I wanted instead was a jQuery-flavored wrapper around the native DOM API that made it easy to create DOM trees leveraging CSS selectors the same way Jade and HAML do.

[Neil Jenkins](http://nmjenkins.com/) makes [some excellent points](http://blog.fastmail.fm/2012/02/20/building-the-new-ajax-mail-ui-part-2-better-than-templates-building-highly-dynamic-web-pages/) why using the DOM instead of templates is a good idea:

> * No need to query the DOM, as you can just save references to nodes you’ll need later as you create them
> * No escaping worries; zero chance of XSS bugs
> * JSHint will validate your syntax
> * Flexibility to use the full power of JS; easily call other functions to generate parts of your DOM tree

He has also written a [JsPerf test](http://jsperf.com/innerhtml-or-dom/4) that shows that using the DOM API is up to 50% faster than using innerHTML in modern browsers.

## Let's build some elements m'kay

[M'kay](https://github.com/fgnass/mkay) is a tiny (556 bytes) plugin for jQuery or Zepto.js. You can use it like this:

{% highlight js %}
var items = 'Click on one of these'.split(' ');

$('body').mk('#message')
  .mk('a.big', "M'kay on GitHub").attr('href', 'https://github.com/fgnass/mkay')._
  .mk('ul', $.map(items, function(text) {
      return $.mk('li.item', text).click(function() {
        alert(text);
      });
  }));​
{% endhighlight %}

This will generate the following HTML and add a click listener to each item:

{% highlight html %}
<div id="message">
  <a class="big" href="https://github.com/fgnass/mkay">M'kay on GitHub</a>
  <ul>
    <li class="item">Click</li>
    <li class="item">on</li>
    <li class="item">one</li>
    <li class="item">of</li>
    <li class="item">these</li>
  </ul>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

You can play with the example above [here on JsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/fgnass/DyW7D/). For sources, tests and documentation please refer to the GitHub [project page](https://github.com/fgnass/mkay).
